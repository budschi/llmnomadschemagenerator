ABSTRACT
Two inch diameter, highly conducting (Si-doped) bulk b-Ga 2O3single crystals with the cylinder length up to one inch were grown by the
Czochralski method. The obtained crystals revealed high structural quality characterized by narrow x-ray rocking curves (FWHM /C2025 arc sec)
and high surface smoothness (RMS <200 pm) of the epi-ready wafers. The free electron concentration and Hall mobility at room temperature
were in the range of 1.6–9 /C21018cm/C03and 118 – 52 cm2V/C01s/C01, respectively, which are not affected by a heat treatment at temperatures up to
1000/C14C in an oxidizing atmosphere. Temperature-dependent electrical properties of the crystals revealed a degenerated semiconducting state.
Both high structural quality and electrical properties make the crystals well suited as substrates for homoepitaxy and electronic device fabricati on
in the vertical conﬁguration.

b-Ga 2O3with its unique combination of great electrical and opti-
cal properties is considered to be a future material in high power elec-
tronics and UV optoelectronics. This is the result of a large bandgap of
4.85 eV1and a high theoretical breakdown ﬁeld of 8 MV/cm.2Indeed,
in the last decade, there has been a signiﬁcant and substantial b-Ga 2O3
development in terms of the growth of bulk crystals, e.g., Refs. 3–12 ,
and thin ﬁlms, e.g., Refs. 13–23 , as well as various device demonstra-
tors, e.g., Refs. 2and 24–32 . Remarkable research on the above-
mentioned aspects of b-Ga 2O3has been summarized in a number of
review articles and books.33–47Particular attention is paid to high
power switching devices that are economical and environmentally
friendly. These requirements can potentially be met by b-Ga 2O3-based
Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) and ﬁeld effect transistors (FETs).
Inb-Ga 2O3-based SBDs and FETs in the vertical conﬁguration,
which can switch higher voltages as compared to the lateral conﬁgura-
tion (due to better exploitation of the breakdown ﬁeld), the substratefunctions as an electrode for an epitaxial drift layer; therefore, it should
have high conductivity represented by the free electron concentration
>1018cm/C03and resistivity on the order of 10/C02Xcm. The substrates
should also be of high structural quality to get high quality epitaxialﬁlms (drift layers) thereon, as structural defects have an impact on the
electrical properties of the ﬁlms and operation of the electronic devi-
ces, such as SBDs.

Availability of large wafers, minimum 2 in. diameter, is required
for device fabrication at the industrial level. Indeed, 2 and 4 in. diame-
ter wafers of b-Ga 2O3have been commercialized,52and 6 in. diameter
wafers were demonstrated53with the use of the EFG method. So far,ter wafers of b-Ga 2O3have been commercialized,52and 6 in. diameter
wafers were demonstrated53with the use of the EFG method. So far,
large diameter wafers, both electrically conducting and semi-insulating, can be fabricated with orientations ð
201Þand (001); how-
ever, other orientations are available in smaller sizes, e.g., the size of
(010) wafers is limited by the cross section of the EFG-grown crystal
slabs, and it is 10 /C215 mm2.52On the other hand, 2 in. diameter

crystals grown by the Czochralski5,6,8,9,36,47,54,55and Bridgman12meth-
ods. Such wafer orientation showed the highest growth rate (due to
strong bonds to the surface) of homoepitaxial thin ﬁlms grown by the
Molecular Beam Epitaxy.19,21,56Although electrically insulating or
semi-insulating b-Ga 2O3crystals of 2 in. diameter can be grown by
the Czochralski method as long cylinders ( >2i n . ) ,6,8,47highly con-
ducting crystals encounter length limitation due to free carrier
absorption.5,8,47,54,57
In this report, we highlight the capability of growing 2 in. diame-
ter, highly conducting bulk b-Ga 2O3single crystals grown by the
Czochralski method, including their basic structural quality and elec-
trical properties that are suitable for electronic device fabrication in the
vertical conﬁguration.
Details of the growth of bulk b-Ga 2O3single crystals by the
Czochralski method with the use of inductively heated Ir crucibles,
including thermodynamics and free carrier absorption issues, as well
as different doping we have already reported in numerous
articles.5–8,55,57–59Here, the initial Si concentration in the starting
material was 0.15–0.2 mol. %, which is sufﬁcient to induce the free
electron concentration (n e)i nt h ec r y s t a l so f1 018–1019cm/C03.S o m eo f
the crystals were also co-doped with Al at initial concentrations in the
starting material of 1, 2.5, and 5 mol. % to enlarge the bandgap. Theequilibrium segregation coefﬁcient for Si and Al in the Ga
2O3melt is
about 0.1 and 1.1, respectively.7The oxygen concentration in the
growth atmosphere, necessary to minimize the formation of elemental
Ga in the melt, was between 14 and 20 vol.%. The growth and rotation
rates were 1.5 mm/h and 5 rpm, while the growth direction was paral-
lel to the h010icrystallographic direction.
As stated above, we could easily reach a cylinder length exceeding
2 in. for 2 in. diameter, semi-insulating b-Ga 2O3crystals (Mg-doped).
The situation drastically changes in the case of highly electrically con-
ducting crystals, where the free carrier absorption has a huge impact
on the growth stability. Shortly, latent heat of crystallization, which is
dissipated away through a growing crystal via radiation in the near-
infrared (NIR) region, is absorbed by the free electrons and cannot be
easily removed from the crystal. After reaching a certain length, heat
accumulation rate exceeds the heat dissipation rate and the tempera-
ture near the growth interface increases. Once it reaches the melting
point of Ga 2O3, there is an interface inversion from convex (stable) to
concave (unstable). The crystal cannot grow vertically as a cylinder
any longer, and it forms a corkscrew (spiral) with windings extending
beyond the cylinder. Such conﬁguration enables easy heat dissipation(small thickness of the windings facing higher temperature gradients).
Generally, the spiral formation in high-melting point oxides
(>1600
/C14C, when radiative heat transport dominates over conductive
one) grown by the Czochralski method is a known phenomenon that
arises from the heat absorption caused by one or more absorption
bands.60–63The symmetry breaking and consequently spiral formation
after interface inversion (highly unstable growth environment) may
have different triggers, such as non-uniform temperature gradients
around the interface, melt ﬂow instability (baroclinic or Marangoni),
and asymmetry of thermal conductivity across the interface, faceting.
In the case of b-Ga 2O3crystals, the heat absorption is caused by free
electrons, which is continuum over the NIR spectral region. Detailed
discussion on the spiral formation during growth of b-Ga 2O3crystals
by the Czochralski method is available elsewhere.5,47,54,55,58This is why highly conducting bulk b-Ga 2O3crystals grown by
the Czochralski method are relatively short, typically about 2 cm forboth 2 cmthe Czochralski method are relatively short, typically about 2 cm forboth 2 cm

Al co-doping (5 mol. %) increased the cylinder length of 2 cm diame-
ter crystals by about 50%,57this is not the case for 2 in. diameter
crystals [ Fig. 1(b) ], due to much larger optical thickness of the former.
Also, higher O 2concentration in the growth atmosphere [ Fig. 1(c) ]
did not increase the cylinder length, which is still about 2 cm.Applying He in the growth atmosphere,
64which has a high thermal
conductivity, increased the crystal length to 2.5 cm [ Fig. 1(d) ]. In each
case, the cylinder length is sufﬁcient to fabricate a number of highlyconducting 1 or 2 in. diameter (010)-oriented wafers.
Most of the Si-doped crystals (only a few are shown in Fig. 1 )
were twin- and grain-free, others had 1 or 2 twins parallel to the {100}plane. Occasionally, small polycrystalline grains occurred. The bluecoloration of the crystals is the result of the free carrier absorption that
extends into the red part of the visible spectrum. This can be recog-
nized from transmittance spectra reported elsewhere.

The primary wafer orientation for homoepitaxial growth by
MOVPE, prepared from Czochralski-grown bulk b-Ga 2O3crystals, is

et al. ,66Bin Anooz et al. ,15,67,68and Chou et al.16After surface treat-
ment of the fabricated wafers, ﬁrst by a wet chemical etching step withphosphoric acid to remove the damage layer resulting from polishingfollowed by an annealing step in O
2at 900/C14C for 60 min, the
RMS roughness was typically between 150 and 200 pm15also shown
inFig. 2 .
Such heat treatment to obtain epi-ready wafers does not affect
their electrical properties. We observed, through annealing experi-
ments depicted in Fig. 3 , an increase in the resistivity by more than
one order of magnitude only after annealing in the oxidizing atmo-sphere (air) at minimum 1000
/C14C for at least several hours (here 20 h).
This is valid for both 2 cm and 2 in. diameter and for both Si- and
SiþAl-doped crystals, which all show the same trend. In Ref. 5,w e
reported that in the case of undoped b-Ga 2O3crystals (free electron

(/C211200/C14C) creates a thin electrically insulating layer on a sample sur-
face, while the bulk conductivity decreases by about an order of mag-
nitude. The latter is due to hydrogen removal that have a high
contribution in the electrical conductivity, as we reported elsewhere.7
Here, by intentional doping with Si, such insulating layer was rathernot formed upon annealing, or it was thinner than the Ohmic contactthickness for Hall effect measurements. The increase in the resistivity
after annealing at high temperatures is due to a decrease in the free
electron concentration associated with hydrogen removal at high tem-peratures (acting as a shallow donor) and next by compensation of aportion of Si by gallium vacancies (acting as deep acceptors), the con-
centration of which increase with oxygen partial pressure during
growth.
69The resistivity of all, highly conducting crystals studied here,
remains substantially intact for annealing temperatures below1000
/C14C. This means that neither the surface heat treatment nor the
growth temperature by MOVPE ( <850/C14C) will affect the electrical
properties of highly conducting Si-doped b-Ga 2O3wafers.
Figure 4(a) shows x-ray rocking curves of Si-doped b-Ga 2O3
(100) samples as-cleaved from 3 different, 2 in. diameter, Si-doped
b-Ga 2O3crystals. Full widths at half maximum (FWHM) values, even
below 20 arc sec, indicate the capability of obtaining high structuralquality samples or wafers for epitaxy. They do not show shoulders that
would indicate the presence of low-angle grains or twin boundaries.FWHM values of the epi-ready (100) 4
/C14off oriented wafers were
between 25 and 35 arc sec.55Co-doping 2 in. diameter crystals with Al
(5 mol. %) resulted in a bit broader rocking curve of FWHM ¼33 arc
sec [Fig. 4(b) ]. An Al incorporation into the b-Ga 2O3crystals lattice
causes easier formation of oxygen-related point defects (lower forma-tion energy) and larger lattice distortion.
70Si-doped, 2 cm diameter
b-Ga 2O3crystal revealed yet broader rocking curve of FWHM
¼46 arc sec [ Fig. 4(b) ]. Simply, Si-doped crystals of small diameter
(2 cm) were grown at much lower oxygen concentration (1–4 vol. %)
in the growth atmosphere as compared with large diameter crystals(2 in.) shown in Fig. 1 . This may lead to a higher density of point
defects (especially oxygen vacancies) as the result of the thermal
decomposition of the melt and larger density of structural defects, like
dislocations (for thermodynamics of Ga
2O3and impact of oxygen
concentration in the growth atmosphere on the crystal growth stabil-
ity, see e.g., Ref. 55).
A relation between free electron (measured by Hall effect, system
HMS 7504 Lake Shore, see details e.g., in Ref. 71) and Si (measured by
Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy, ICP-
OES, system Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, iCap7400) concentrations of
Si-doped b-Ga 2O3crystals is shown in Fig. 5 . An approximately 1:1
relation indicates almost full activation of Si in the crystals, similar tosmaller diameter crystals.
7Occasional deviation from this relation
arises from a nonuniform radial and axial Si distribution due to segre-
gation phenomenon (low segregation coefﬁcient /C250.1). Because the
crystallization ratio is rather small (about 15%), the axial Si segregation
supposed to be small; however, it might be larger at regions of large
changes in the interface shape, in particular, in the region of the inter-
face inversion. On the other hand, changes in the interface shape willinduce some radial Si segregation, which may differ between crystals.
Here, in highly conducting crystals, a possible contribution of hydro-
gen in the free electron concentration, which is visible at smaller n
e
values ( <1018cm/C03),7does not play a signiﬁcant role, as it is governedgen in the free electron concentration, which is visible at smaller n
e
values ( <1018cm/C03),7does not play a signiﬁcant role, as it is governed
by the Si concentration. The same relates to trace impurities, such asIr, Fe, Al, Ca, Mg, and Zr (determined by ICP-OES), which are always
found in bulk b-Ga
2O3crystals grown by the Czochralski method
with a typical concentration of around or below 1017cm/C03each.55,72
2 in. diameter, Si-doped b-Ga 2O3single crystals revealed free
electron concentration (n e), electron mobility, and resistivity from
Hall effect measurements at room temperature (RT) in the ranges of
1.6–9 /C21018cm/C03,1 1 8–5 2 c m2V/C01s/C01,a n d4–1 /C210/C02Xcm,
respectively. We noticed, however, that n evalues may differ within an
as-grown crystal by factor of 2–3, which might be correlated with
changes in the interface shape and associated differences in Si incorpo-
ration. Annealing at elevated temperatures ( <1000/C14C) made the ne
values and resistivity more uniform (see Fig. 3 ).Figure 6 shows a rela-
tion between Hall electron mobility and free electron concentration
for 2 in. diameter Si- and Si þAl-doped b-Ga 2O3single crystals, in
comparison with 2 cm diameter ones. At n e>1018cm/C03, all the crys-
tals show a dominant electron scattering at ionized impurities.73
Comparing both diameter crystals, it is clear that an average Hall elec-
tron mobility is higher for 2 in. diameter crystals at similar n evalues,
which is likely due to a better structural quality of the samples from
larger crystals (for comparison see rocking curves in Fig. 4 ). The Hall
electron mobility for Al co-doped 2 in. diameter crystals is in average
lower than in those doped with Si only, which was already observed
for 2 cm diameter crystals.57This is likely due to above-mentioned

and, thus, electron mobility reduction.
Figure 7 shows the temperature-dependent (22–300 K) resistivity
and free electron concentration of Si-doped b-Ga 2O3single crystals
having different n evalues at RT (measured by Hall effect with the use
of a closed-cycle refrigerator cryostat). For very low Si doping level,
resulting in n e¼5/C21017cm/C03at RT, the relation is typical for normal
semiconductors. For higher Si doping level and n e¼5/C21018cm/C03at
RT, the behavior is typical for degenerate semiconductors, as both theresistivity and n
eare basically temperature independent (metallic-like
conductivity). Between these n evalues, i.e., for n e¼2.2 and 3.5
/C21018cm/C03at RT ( Fig. 7 ), we can observe a very weak dependence
indicating a semiconductor–metal transition region (Mott transition),
which match previously reported values (n e¼3–5/C21018cm/C03)f o r
b-Ga 2O3.74,75
Similar relations, but for a temperature range of 300–600 K, are
shown in Fig. 8 (measured by Hall effect with the use of an oven mod-
ule). In each case, the resistivity ( q) increases by a factor of about 2 at
600 K [ Fig. 8(a) ]. As can be seen in Fig. 8(b) , there is only a minor
increase in the free electron concentration (n e) as basically all shallowdonors had been ionized at around RT. At higher temperatures,
deeper electron traps are being depopulated and release electrons thatcontribute to the electrical conductivity. The factor that increases theresistivity above RT is a decrease in the Hall electron mobility ( l
e),
also by a factor of about 2 ðq/C241

of lattice vibrations, which enhance scattering of the free electrons at
phonons. The scattering is higher at higher free electron concentration,which is well visible in Fig. 8(b) for two samples with the highest n
e
values (3.5 and 5 /C21018cm/C03). Such factor of resistivity increase in b-
Ga2O3is typical for metals in the same temperature range.

conductivity, achieved by Si-doping, were grown by the Czochralskimethod. Crystal samples showed high structural quality (FWHM ofthe rocking curve /C2025 arc sec) and good surface smoothness (RMS
